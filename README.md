## Why Use It?

Moving Azure resources isn't always straightforward. Not every resource type supports every move operation, and finding that out mid-migration can cost hours.

**Cloud Move Analyzer** lets you upload a spreadsheet exported from the Azure Portal and instantly see a clear, filterable report of what can — and can't — be moved.

### ✅ Key Features

|---------|-------------|
| **Instant analysis** | Upload `.csv`, `.xlsx`, or `.xls` and get results in seconds |
| **3 move checks** | Resource Group, Subscription, and Region move support |
| **Smart column detection** | Automatically detects Type, Name, Resource Group, Location, and Resource ID columns |
| **Smart notes** | Migration dependencies, constraints, and direct links to official docs |
| **Search & filter** | Find specific resources or filter by move status |
| **CSV export** | Download results with translated headers for documentation or planning |
| **Template download** | Download a pre-formatted spreadsheet template to get started |
| **Deduplication** | Automatically removes duplicate resources from your spreadsheet |
| **9 FAQs** | SEO-optimized FAQ section with step-by-step guides |
| **8 languages** | 🇺🇸 🇧🇷 🇨🇳 🇪🇸 🇫🇷 🇸🇦 🇷🇺 🇯🇵 |
| **Dark & Light mode** | Light theme by default, with dark mode toggle |
| **100% private** | All processing happens in your browser — zero data leaves your machine |

## How It Works

1. Go to [**cloudmoveanalyzer.com**](https://cloudmoveanalyzer.com/)
2. Export your resources from the [Azure Portal → All Resources → Export to CSV](https://portal.azure.com/#browse/all)
3. Upload the file — the tool checks each resource type against [Microsoft's official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/move-support-resources)
4. Review the report: filter, search, sort by clicking column headers, and export as CSV

> **No signup. No login. No data sent anywhere.**

## Data Source

Move support data is sourced from Microsoft's official [resource-capabilities](https://github.com/tfitzmac/resource-capabilities) repository and is refreshed automatically on each page load to ensure you always have the latest information.
